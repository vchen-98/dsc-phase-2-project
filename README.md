# Phase 2 Project

## Business Understanding

Our client is Genesis Capital, a house flipping company, and they are wanting to get in the martel in king county. Being that they are not from king county they need some help to understand the market. They want to know out of all the feathers for the house in king county which features have the most significant effect on the price of a house.They also want to know which feathers affect the houseâ€™s price the most, both positively and negatively.

### Business Problem

Business Questions:

What features affect the price significantly?
How do they affect the price, positive and negative ?


## Data Understanding

Interpretation:
This data set is a record of house sales in King County, Washington, between 2014 and 2015. It includes information like the number of bedrooms, square footage (important!), condition, the year it was built, the year it was renovated (if applicable), and the zipcode and latitude/longitude. From this data, we can extrapolate location, age of the house, and size of the house, giving us a good look at how these factors affect the price.

Target: Price

Available Predictors: bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living space, square footage of the lot, numuber of floors, waterfront house or not, number of viewers, condition based on a numeric scale, grade based on a numeric scale, square footage of the basement, year the house was built, year the house was renovated, zipcode, latitude/longitude, and square footage of living space of the nearest 15 neighbors

## Data Preparation

## Modeling

## Conclusion



## Project Overview

For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

### Business Problem

It is up to you to define a stakeholder and business problem appropriate to this dataset.

If you are struggling to define a stakeholder, we recommend you complete a project for a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. A business problem you could focus on for this stakeholder is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic for instructions on creating and submitting your deliverables. Refer to the rubric associated with this assignment for specifications describing high-quality deliverables.

### Key Points

* **Your deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process.** Refer to [the Data Science Process lesson](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-processes) from Topic 19 for more information about process models you can use.

* **Your Jupyter Notebook should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling.** This means that you begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs discussing your final model - this should include interpreting at least 3 important parameter estimates or statistics.

* **Based on the results of your models, your notebook and presentation should discuss at least two features that have strong relationships with housing prices.**

## Getting Started

Start on this project by forking and cloning [this project repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project) to get a local copy of the dataset.

We recommend structuring your project repository similar to the structure in [the Phase 1 Project Template](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template). You can do this either by creating a new fork of that repository to work in or by building a new repository from scratch that mimics that structure.

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.
